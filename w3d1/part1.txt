in start method:" this.timer = setInterval(() => this.render(), 1000);"

setInterval accepts to parameters, fuction and time in millisecond. 
since render is a method(not a function) in a class, we can not directly put in the function argument of the setInterval. So, 
we put render() as a return inside anonymous function and solved.

2. super constructor should be called by the derived class in the first line before intialization the derived class's own fields(first line after the constructor call)
