1. " this.timer = setInterval(() => this.render(), 1000);"
    the main thing as far as i understood is when we call events we need a function that returns a function. one option is using closure. 
    and the other way as i learned in this lesson is on how to use the class to call the event functions, 
    by passing the wrapper function as in the setTimeout(() => button.click(), 1000).


2. super constructor in derived class must be called and initialized within child class constructor before accessing 'this' or returning.
